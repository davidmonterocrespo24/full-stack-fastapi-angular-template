Description:

Welcome to the StarterKit-Angular-FastAPI-Material repository, your ultimate starting point for developing scalable and robust web projects. This repository is designed to provide you with a solid foundation using modern and powerful technologies such as Angular, Formly.dev, Material Design for Angular, Python with FastAPI, and PostgreSQL as the relational database.

Key Features:

Angular: The Angular frontend development framework provides a solid and modular structure for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Formly.dev: Simplifies form creation in Angular by providing a clean, declarative syntax for defining complex forms with built-in validation.

Material Design for Angular: Utilizes Material Design components specifically designed for Angular to create beautiful and consistent user interfaces with ease.
